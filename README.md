# Warning: it uses selenium so it fucks the tokens and I am too lazy to make one that uses the API

# discord-nitro-token-sorter
Tool that sorts discord tokens depending on whether the tokens have nitro or not

# How to use
1. Run ```setup.bat```
2. Paste your tokens into ```tokens.txt``` (one per line)

If you have any issues create one or DM me on discord (thk6634#1432)
